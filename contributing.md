# Contributing

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

This project was started to help external (frontend) developers to render the templates without running the actual Onegini IdP. Your input is valuable to 
improve this project.

We have a few rules:

* If the bug is a security vulnerability, refer to our [security policy](https://onegini.com/.well-known/security.txt) and don't create a pull request in this 
project.
* Example configuration should be clean: no references to customer names, people or credentials
* Configuration should work on any machine, or the documentation should mention how to customize the configuration
* Only add configuration files for templates that exist in the standard products. 
* Use spaces, not tabs, unless the language requires to use tabs
* Third party libraries should have a license that is compatible with the license of this project
* Keep the documentation up to date

Thank you for taking the time to read this page!
